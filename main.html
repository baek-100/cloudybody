  Welcome to <strong>CloudyBody</strong>.
  <br><br><img src="logo_.jpg" width="90%">
  <p style="margin-top:20px"><u>Introducing the innovative system, CloudyBody.</u>
  <br>How have we lived so far? Didn't you buy a lot of health food and medical devices out of sheer hope that you'd get rid of your fatigue by buying a lot of pills and injection medical devices every day?
  If you're the type with a little more time and will, you might have been visiting a fitness center and working steadily to increase your muscle mass.
  <br>We have developed a service that will solve your problems at once.</p>
  <p>From now on, you can borrow your hands more easily from your friends when you need them, and give them a hand when you want to help your friends in other countries!
  Right through the body.</p>
  When you can't lift heavy things, you can borrow and use muscles from your friends, and when your eyes are stiff from lack of sleep, you can borrow someone's vision.
  <br>It's not a hassle to borrow someone's body.
  <br>If you're on the other side of the globe, we'll solve the space constraints with our groundbreaking cloud system!</p>

  <p style="margin-top:50px">Let me explain <u>how to use CloudyBody!</u>
  <br>To lend someone your body, first register your body with the CloudyBody Server.
  <br>At this time, you can selectively register only the part of your body that you want.
  If you decide which body to register, please check with the CloudyBody server.
  <br>CloudyBody puts safety first.
  <br>Please wait for a moment to check the stability of your chosen body!
  <br>Once successfully registered, you can now exchange your body with your friend.</p>
